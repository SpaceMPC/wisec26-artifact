	9979 triples of gfp left
Significant amount of unused triples of gfp distorting the benchmark. This protocol has a large minimum batch size, which makes this unavoidable for small programs.
	827 bits of gfp left
	3768 squares of gfp left
Significant amount of unused squares of gfp distorting the benchmark. For more accurate benchmarks, consider reducing the batch size with --batch-size.

This program might benefit from some protocol options.
Consider adding the following at the beginning of your code:
	program.use_trunc_pr = True
	program.use_edabit(True)
